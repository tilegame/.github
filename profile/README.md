# TileGame Overview

The TileGame is an experimental 2D online game chatroom, written 
with Golang and Javascript, where you can chat with anybody who goes 
to the same webpage in their browser. Everybody has a cat character, 
and can easily type in their chat message, which will appear above 
your character, and is visible to everybody else who is also online!


# Motivation

I wrote this primarily for educational purposes. My goals were to 
learn about computer networking in general, and more specifically how 
to write and run servers. I also wanted to learn how to design APIs 
that can be accessed by a client that is written using different tools
or languages than the server, to allow for different clients 
(including automated bot clients) to be built.
